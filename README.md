## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique by [Frances Cocirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) designed to create blocks of focused time - usually 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break between each iteration.

## Why build another Pomodoro app?

There are a wide variety of Pomodoro apps on the market already but I've found they all do too much. Tomodoro is a minimalist timer that doesn't get in the way, isn't a fancy todo list, and doesn't take over your screen when it's time to take a break.

This was also a great opportunity for me to get started with Swift.
